# This is the master configuration file for the Terrainosaurus terrain
# generation engine. Modify the settings in here to configure paths and
# GA parameters.

# Note that all section names, property names, and values are case-insensitive,
# except for filesystem paths on case-sensitive filesystems (e.g., UNIX).
# While Windows-style paths (using '\') are accepted on Windows, this is not
# portable to other OS's, so it is better to use UNIX-style paths (using '/'),
# which are accepted everywhere. If a value contains whitespace, double-quotes,
# or single-quotes it must be enclosed in either double- or single-quotes.

# Scalar values may be expressed in any of the following formats (all of the
# following examples are equivalent):
#   Floating point:     0.25
#   Percentage:         25%
#   Scientific:         25.0e-2

# The [Application] section configures the general behavior of the application,
# including various filesystem locations. Filesystem paths, if not absolute
# paths (starting with a '/' or a Windows drive letter) are interpreted to be
# relative to the Terrainosaurus home directory, which is set with the
# TERRAINOSAURUS_HOME environment variable (falling back to a compiled-in
# default if that variable is unset).
#
# The properties allowed in this section are:
#       Cache Directory     where to store terrain analysis cache files;
#                           this directory should be on a filesystem with
#                           several hundred megabytes free space
#

# The remaining sections configure the genetic algorithms used in
# Terrainosaurus. The parameters controlled here are not part of the regular,
# user-level interface to Terrainosaurus, and do not normally need to be
# changed. Do so at your own risk. The following parameters are common to all
# GA sections, and will not be repeated in the documentation for each section:
#   population size         an integer # of chromosomes in the population
#   evolution cycles        an integer # of iterations that the GA is run
#   selection ratio         a scalar % of the population to survive each cycle
#   elitism ratio           a scalar top % of the population to survive
#   mutation probability    scalar odds of a chromosome being mutated
#   mutation ratio          scalar % of genes that are mutated
#   crossover probability   scalar odds of a chromosome being cross-bred
#   crossover ratio         scalar % of genes that are exchanged

# The [Boundary GA] section configures the 2D map boundary generation GA.
# In addition to the standard GA parameters, it also supports:
#   max absolute angle      a positive angle indicating the maximum allowable
#                           angle between a segment and the X axis

# The [Heightfield GA] section configures the heightfield generation GA.
# In addition to the standard GA parameters, it also supports:
#   gene size               an integer size of a gene in pixels;
#                           a value of N will result in genes with NxN pixels
#   overlap factor          a scalar percent overlap between adjacent genes;
#                           0.0 means 'no overlap' and 1 means 'complete
#                           overlap'. Values in [0.1 to 0.5] make the most sense.
#   max crossover width     an integer giving the maximum width of a
#                           rectangular cluster of genes that can be crossed;
#                           a value of N will result in clusters of, at most,
#                           NxN genes being exchanged at a time
#   max vertical scale      a scalar giving the maximum factor by which to
#                           scale a gene in a single scaling mutation; 1.0
#                           means 'no scaling', whereas 3.0 means 'up to 3x'
#                           The inverse is the lower limit (e.g., 0.333333)
#   max vertical offset     a scalar giving the maximum distance in meters
#                           by which to offset a gene in a single offset
#                           mutation
