# This is a terrain library file, for use with the Terrainosaurus terrain
# generation engine. This file describes the properties of logical terrain
# types (in terms of examples) and of seams (boundaries) between them (in terms
# of smoothness).
#
# TerrainType and TerrainSeam records may be interspersed, but any TerrainSeam
# records must *follow* the TerrainType records they reference, or else a
# 'non-existent TerrainType' error will occur.

# The [TerrainLibrary] section defines the properties of the whole library.
# Properties allowed in this section are:
#   base directory      ??
#   map directory       ??
#   elevation directory??

###############################################################################
# [TerrainType] sections define different, logical "terrain types". Each
# TerrainType must have a unique name. The properties allowed in TerrainType
# sections are:
#   color       a color used to characterize the terrain type
#   sample      the base-name of an example of this type of terrain; there
#               may be arbitrarily many of these, and there must be AT LEAST
#               one, for each terrain type
