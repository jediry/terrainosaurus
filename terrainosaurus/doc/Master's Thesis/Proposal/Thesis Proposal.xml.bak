  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <title> Introduction </title>
    <paragraph>
      Computer-rendered terrain is an important facet of most applications that attempt to represent the natural world in some way, 
      including geographic information systems (GIS) applications, CG-animated feature films, virtual reality systems, and computer 
      games. The ability to synthesize large-scale, realistic terrain models would be of considerable interest for these applications 
      (with the exception of the GIS-related applications, which are generally only interested in representing faithfully the earth's 
      landscape as it actually is).
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      Much of the recent research in virtual terrain has centered around accelerating the visualization of large terrains to achieve 
      interactive frame rates, resulting in a wide array of <term>level-of-detail (LOD)</term> algorithms, which are methods of 
      increasing rendering speed through omitting fine detail that would be indiscernable to the viewer <citation ref="ROAM"/> 
      <citation ref="Chunked LOD"/> <citation ref="Geometry Clipmaps"/> <citation ref="Feature-based CLOD"/>.  Recent, dramatic advances 
      in the performance and capabilities of graphics accelerators have enabled the presentation of richly-detailed terrain models at 
      interactive frame-rates, and have sparked increased interest in representing outdoor phenomena, as evidenced by the prominence 
      of nature-related techniques at a recent Game Developer's Conference <citation ref="GDC 2002"/>.  The visually stunning outdoor 
      scenes in the recent video game title Halo are solid evidence that believable terrain can be achieved with current technology 
      <citation ref="Halo"/>.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      Terrain generation, in contrast, has received relatively little treatment in the literature. The most prevalent techniques are 
      fractal-based, because they are easily implemented, require relatively little processing time and human input, and yield at 
      least mediocre results, allowing random, unique terrains to be generated on-the-fly. However, as Losasso &amp; Hoppe <citation 
      ref="Geometry Clipmaps"/> and Pelton &amp; Atkinson <citation ref="Wavelet Synthesis"/> have noted, fractal methods for 
      terrain generation are limited in the types of terrain they can simulate, and one generally has to resort to GIS elevation maps 
      to get more interesting and believable terrain models.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      In this proposal I describe a new methodology for terrain generation, which I expect will be able to synthesize realistic
      terrain models composed of a variety of terrain types. In this approach, GIS elevation data is fed as raw input to a genetic 
      algorithm which generates unique, synthetic terrain models that are similar in their relevant characteristics to the input 
      elevation data. My approach should be able to handle any type (or combination of types) of terrain, and at multiple levels of 
      detail, up to the resolution of the input elevation data. Finer detail could be synthesized atop the GIS-based terrain through  
      the use of existing techniques such as detail-map textures and fractal noise). The user is able to specify the shape and 
      placement of various regions of terrain via a CAD-style map-drawing interface, which could be extended to permit a finer degree 
      of user control (such as choosing the placement of individual features).

  <!-- IDEALIZED TERRAIN GENERATION -->
  <section>
    <title> Idealized Terrain Generation </title>
    <paragraph>
      Before I turn to the task of describing my approach to terrain generation, it is worth spending some time on the question of 
      what makes an algorithm for terrain generation "good". What features would characterize an "ideal" methodology?
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      As is the case with many difficult problems, in terrain generation we are confronted with a number of parameters 
      that we would like to optimize, but which are in tension with one another. An ideal terrain generation algorithm 
      would:
    </paragraph>
      <list>
        <item> require a low degree of human input </item>
        <item> allow a high degree of human control </item>
        <item> be able to reproduce a wide variety of recognizable terrain types and features in believable relationship to one another 
        </item>
        <item> produce models at arbitrary levels of detail </item>
        <item> run quickly enough to be used in real-time, dynamic applications </item>
        <item> be extensible to support new terrain types and features </item>
      </list>
    <paragraph>
      Obviously, accomplishing all of these goals simultaneously is probably impossible. Nevertheless, having such an ideal in view gives us a 
      yardstick with which to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches to terrain synthesis.
    </paragraph>

    <section>
      <title> Low Degree of Human Input </title>
      <paragraph>
        Digital terrain models typically involve large amounts of data. For example, a standard 10-meter USGS DEM (digital elevation 
        model) <citation ref="DEM Specification"/> contains more than 10,000 data points per square kilometer. If an artist is required to 
        be involved in the determination of each data point, this adds up to an enormous amount of painstaking work on the part of the 
        artist. Any terrain construction detail that can be offloaded from the artist to the algorithm should result in a corresponding 
        increase in human productivity. An ideal generation methodology would accept a request such as "randomly generate a 
        1000x1000-point desert terrain", and produce a believable result.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        If the inputs required by an algorithm are sufficiently minimal, it may afford, in addition to the increase in artist 
        productivity, a second benefit: the algorithm may be useful for generating unique terrains at runtime (e.g., as a random level 
        generator for a game).
      </paragraph>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title> High Degree of Human Control </title>
      <paragraph>
        In obvious tension with the previous ideal is the goal of permitting the artist to exert an arbitrarily fine degree of control 
        over the features and characteristics of the generated terrain. To give an artist full creative freedom requires that he be 
        able to specify both low-frequency features (hills, valleys, mountains, etc.) and high-frequency features (cracks, cliffs, and 
        gorges), at both global and local levels. An ideal algorithm would permit the artist to exert whatever control he wished, where 
        he wished, while intelligently filling in the details the artist doesn't care about.
      </paragraph>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title> Diverse, Believable Features and Terrain Types </title>
      <paragraph>
        A terrain generation algorithm that is able to believably produce only a narrow range of terrain types and features will 
        inherently be limited in its usefulness. An ideal algorithm would be able to create a wide diversity of terrain types (e.g., 
        desert, mountains, plains) and features (e.g. ravines, riverbeds, volcanoes), both from the real world and from the 
        imagination of the artist. Additionally, the seams where terrain types meet (e.g., the transition from mountains to foothills) 
        would be believable, and the placement of semantic features would make sense (e.g., waterfalls would pour into pools, rivers 
        would not flow uphill).
      </paragraph>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title> Arbitrary Level-of-Detail </title>
      <paragraph>
        It is precisely because terrain models involve such large quantities of data that continuous level of detail (CLOD) algorithms 
        are necessary for their visualization. But full-detail terrain models are not always needed, the requisite level-of-detail 
        being determined by their intended use. For example, a model meant to be a backdrop in a computer animated film would need 
        highly realstic detail only in the areas where the action was to take place, and could use relatively simple geometry in the 
        other areas.  Similarly, the level of detail required for the terrain of a flight simulation is dramatically different than 
        what is needed for ground-level action. An ideal terrain generation algorithm would permit the creation of terrains at 
        multiple levels of detail, and the segmentation of large terrains into regions of differing level-of-detail.
      </paragraph>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title> Fast Enough for Real-Time Applications </title>
      <paragraph>
        Some terrain-processing algorithms require a lengthy preprocessing phase <citation ref="Chunked LOD"/> <citation ref="L3DT"/> 
        before the terrain can be used in a real-time application. Intuitively, we would expect all but the most simplistic terrain 
        generation algorithms to fall into this category. Nonetheless, an algorithm that could do all or most of its processing "on the 
        fly", would provide several important advantages, including:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
        <item> instantaneous feedback to the artist of the effects of a particular modification </item>
        <item> the ability to modify dynamically the terrain in fundamental and interesting ways (such as transforming a mountain into a 
          crater, or rapidly eroding a riverbed into a deep gorge) </item>
        <item> enormous savings in the amount of memory and disk storage required (if the terrain could be generated from a small set of 
          parameters) </item>
        <item> the ability to create seamless, infinite worlds (if these parameters are defined at every point in the virtual world) 
        </item>
      </list>

      <title> Terrain Representation, Visualization &amp; Use </title>
      <paragraph>
        The majority of the terrain generation and visualization literature is concerned with <term>heightfields</term>, 2D 
        rectangular grids of elevation data. Other representations of terrain are certainly possible, but heightfields offer several 
        nice advantages that make them popular.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Conceptually, heightfields are very similar to grayscale images. As a result, a heightfield terrain representation is 
        convenient because it enables existing image-based methods for creation, manipulation, compression, storage and analysis to be 
        reused for terrain.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        The regular grid structure of the heightfield is central to many of the existing <term>continuous level of detail 
        (CLOD)</term> algorithms, which render portions of the terrain near the viewer with many triangles and far-off portions with 
        fewer triangles <citation ref="ROAM"/>, <citation ref="Geometry Clipmaps"/>.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Heightfields are restricted to depicting terrains in which elevation is a function of the grid coordinates. In other words, 
        the terrain must pass the vertical line test: features like overhangs and caves, where a vertical line would intersect the 
        surface multiple times, cannot be represented directly with heightfields. In practice, this limitation is not especially 
        cumbersome, as most terrain is fairly well-behaved and exceptions (such as the aforementioned caves and overhangs) can be 
        handled as special cases. Furthermore, the simplicity of a 2D representation for terrain allows operations like path-finding 
        and collision detection to be simplified.

      <title> Methods of Terrain Generation </title>
      <paragraph>
        Terrain generation has not received nearly as much attention in the literature as terrain LOD rendering has, with 
        relatively few innovations to date. The terrain generation methods that currently exist in the literature generally fall into 
        one or more of the following four categories. After considering the various strengths and weaknesses of each of these 
        approaches, I will briefly survey current software packages for terrain generation, paying attention to which of these 
        techniques they use.
      </paragraph>

      <section>
        <title> GIS-based Methods </title>
        <paragraph>
          Probably the most obvious place to look for natural-looking terrain data is in nature itself. High-quality elevation maps of the 
          entire United States (and some other parts of the world) can be downloaded or ordered from the U.S. Geological Survey <citation 
          ref="USGS Maps"/> and other mapping agencies, at resolutions as high as 3 inches per sample in some cases, and in several 
          formats (older elevation maps are available in the older DEM format <citation ref="DEM Specification"/>, with more recent data 
          available only in the more complex SDTS format <citation ref="SDTS Specification"/>). GIS data is ideal for applications whose 
          primary concern is realism, such as cartographic software <citation ref="ArcGIS"/>, and simulations <citation ref="SimCity 4"/>, 
          <citation ref="FS 2004"/>. This approach has the advantage of producing a high degree of realism with relatively little human 
          effort. The major drawback to GIS technology is the constraint that it imposes: only real-world locations that are present in a 
          mapping agency's data can be used. For many applications, this constraint may unacceptably compromise artistic freedom (e.g., a 
          movie director may require a particular arrangement of mountains and rivers) or other, more utilitarian goals (e.g., the setting 
          for a military simulation might require particular terrain features). A second disadvantage of GIS-based methods is the 
            significant amount of space required to store a large dataset.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          My approach improves upon the naïve GIS-based approach, retaining its strength (high degree of realism for a low expenditure 
          of human effort) while circumventing its primary drawback (static terrain configuration).
        </paragraph>

        <title> Procedural Methods </title>
        <paragraph>
          Procedural methods for terrain generation date back as far as 1977 <citation ref="Combat Simulation"/> <citation 
          ref="Procedure Models"/>, and are largely the domain of artists and game developers <citation ref="Lighthouse 3D"/> <citation 
          ref="Fluid Simulation"/>, and are generally optimized for speed and/or ease of implementation rather than for realism.  
          Procedural techniques almost always incorporate a random noise generator at some point and (ideally) produce unique results 
          each time.  And since the random noise generator usually provides most or all of the information needed to build the 
          terrain, landscapes constructed via procedural methods usually require little or no human input, and can be of arbitrary 
          levels of detail. Additionally, if the procedure is fast enough, random terrain models can be created at application startup 
          (or even on-the-fly), obviating the need to store any heightfield data at all. As a result, procedural techniques are ideal for 
          generating random terrains and infinite worlds. The principal drawback of these methods is that they generally have no causal 
          connection to the real-world terrain they try to simulate, instead bearing only an incidental resemblance (in other words, they 
          only happen to look terrain-like rather than being somehow derived from actual terrrain). Because of this, most procedural 
          methods are only useful for simulating a limited range of terrain types. In addition, since the procedural parameters do not 
          typically correspond to real-world terrain characteristics, achieving a desired effect is likely to be an exercise in trial and 
          error.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          Some of the most popular procedural techniques are fractal in nature, such as the midpoint displacement method 
          <citation ref="MPD Method"/> and Perlin's noise function <citation ref="Texturing and Modeling"/>. These techniques exhibit 
          the fractal property of self-similarity at different scales, and generally involve perturbing the height values of the 
          terrain by increasingly smaller amounts at increasingly finer scales. Prusinkiewicz &amp; Hammel describe an interesting 
          method for generating mountains with an integrated river network that is entirely fractal in nature <citation ref="Mountains 
          and Rivers"/>.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          A similar class of procedural techniques in common practice could be described as "collaging" methods <citation 
          ref="Area51"/>. In these techniques, an irregular heightfield is created through the random superposition of simple shapes, 
          such as spheres, cones, half-planes, or 2D trigonometric functions. After several hundred iterations, the result is a random 
          heightfield posessing similar curvature and smoothness characteristics to the primitive shape, but without any of the 
          primitive shapes apparent in the terrain.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          The spectral synthesis family of procedural techniques involves constructing a frequency-spectrum representation of a 
          terrain and performing the inverse FFT or inverse wavelet transform to produce a spatial-domain terrain <citation 
          ref="Wavelet Synthesis"/> <citation ref="Spectral Synthesis"/>. In the simplest case, the frequency components would be 
          calculated according to some random noise function.  Pelton &amp; Atkinson describe a wavelet synthesis approach based on 
          the frequency histogram of a GIS elevation map, noting that their approach is successful at creating a unique heightfield 
          with similar roughness characteristics to the original, but that it fails to capture semantic features, specifically 
          riverbeds <citation ref="Wavelet Synthesis"/>.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          My approach is similar to existing procedural methods in that it iteratively constructs unique landscapes using controlled 
          random processes, but unlike the methods discussed above, it also tries to analyze its performance and to weed out 
          unsuccessful attempts.

        <title> Sculpture-based Methods </title>
        <paragraph>
          At the opposite end of the spectrum, in terms of human effort, is the use of artistic tools to paint or sculpt the features 
          of the terrain. In most cases, this means using computer-based modeling and painting tools (such as Adobe Photoshop, Bryce 
          3D, or Maya) or specialized "level editors" (as in the recent games SimCity 4 <citation ref="SimCity 4"/> and 
          Unreal Tournament 2004 <citation ref="UT 2004"/>). Less commonly, an artist might create a model using traditional physical 
          media and digitize it using laser scanning techniques, as was done to create the terrain for the video game title Trespasser 
          <citation ref="Trespasser Postmortem"/>. The primary advantage of sculpture-based methods is the enormous freedom given to 
          the artist.  Anything the artist can imagine can be created.  This is also its main drawback &#8212; this method of terrain 
          generation requires a large investment of human time and effort to produce good results.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          My approach allows a human designer to influence the shape and features of the terrain by specifying the relationships between 
          different types of terrain, but does not rely on the designer for determining the high-frequency details of the model.
        </paragraph>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title> Simulation-based Methods </title>
        <paragraph>
          Another family of terrain generation methods involves the simulation of physical processes (such as plate tectonics or 
          erosion) to evolve the terrain <citation ref="Area51"/> <citation ref="Stream Erosion"/> <citation ref="Eroded Fractal 
          Terrains"/>. These methods can produce highly believable results, since they emulate the same processes that create 
          real-world terrain, but typically require very high amounts of processing time.

        <title> Existing Terrain Generation Tools </title>
        <paragraph>
          While the list of terrain generation engines is too large to be reviewed exhaustively, it is worthwhile to make note of a 
          representative sample of the more prominent of these. Most of these applications permit the use of more than one of the 
          above techniques as a way of mitigating some of the weaknesses of each.

            modifying the resultant heightfields. It offers an integrated raytracing engine including some very nice cloud, water, and

          <paragraph>
            World Machine is a procedural heightfield generation tool, free for non-commercial use. Its most interesting 
            aspect is that it treats the terrain creation process as composed of simple "device" primitives (e.g., Perlin noise 
            generator, gaussian blur filter, etc.) which the user can connect to form a "machine" (a directed acyclic graph) that 
            will produce the heightfield. The main benefit of this approach over a more traditional fractal/sculpting approach is 
            that since the series of operations is preserved as a DAG, the user is free to tweak any parameter of any 
            operation at any time, as opposed to having to commit to a particular filter size or random seed at the outset <citation 
            ref="World Machine"/>.

      <title> Genetic Algorithms </title>
      <paragraph>
        Unfortunately, some of the more interesting problems in computer science fall into the class of "NP hard" problems, and become 
        intractably difficult as the size of the problem increases <citation ref="Algorithms"/>. In these problems, it is often not 
        feasible to find a perfect solution, and approximation techniques must be used. <term>Genetic algorithms (GA)</term> is one such 
        class of techniques.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Conceptually, a genetic algorithm tries to evolve better and better solutions to its problem through mutation and "breeding". 
        In GA terms, a single possible solution within the solution space of the problem is called an <term>individual</term> or a 
        <term>chromosome</term>. A <term>fitness function</term> provides an evaluation of how good a solution any particular individual 
        is, expressed as a scalar value. As the GA iterates, new potential solutions to the problem are explored by taking the more 
        "fit" of the existing individuals and combining parts of them (their <term>genes</term>) to create new individuals having 
        characteristics of both "parents". By iteratively evolving a <term>population</term> (set of individuals) of some fixed size, 
        the GA explores the solution space in a parallel fashion. Hopefully, after some reasonable number of iterations, the most "fit" 
        of the individuals in the final population will be fairly close to an optimal solution <citation ref="Genetic Algorithms"/>.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        My approach to terrain generation uses genetic algorithms at two stages. An appropriately designed fitness function will be 
        able to discriminate between plausible, natural-looking terrains and those which do not appear natural. By incorporating this 
        fitness evaluation as a sort of intelligent feedback loop in the generation process, I expect to be able to synthesize new, 
        unique terrain models that still maintain the qualities of the original GIS data.

  <section>
    <title> Proposed Thesis Research </title>

    <section>
      <title> Overview </title>
      <paragraph>
        I propose a new methodology for terrain construction based on the use of genetic algorithms to synthesize terrain using GIS 
        elevation data as input. Fundamental to the approach is the concept of a <term>terrain type</term>, which I define as a class of 
        terrain features with semantic meaning to the user (e.g., "desert", "steep mountains", "rolling hills", etc.) and one or more 
        associated sample GIS heightfield samples typical of that terrain type. The samples within a single terrain type should bear 
        resemblance to one another in some set of measurable characteristics (i.e., one instance of "glacier" should have similar 
        characteristics to another instance of the same type, and both should have dissimilar parameters to an instance of "desert").  
        These terrain types will be used as building blocks by the user to create arbitrarily complex terrains.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        At a high level, the approach consists of an optional user input step, followed by two genetic algorithm steps. Starting with one 
        or more predefined terrain types, the user is allowed to specify the general desired configuration by drawing a rough, 2D map of 
        connected polygonal regions and specifying the terrain type of each region. The algorithm then generates more complex, 
        natural-looking boundaries approximating the straight lines of the polygonal map, in order to avoid the presence of unrealistic 
        straight lines in the output heightfield. Finally, it constructs a heightfield of the requested size and shape by splatting 
        together compatible chunks of terrain data from the GIS samples. A population of such landscapes will be generated, and the most 
        fit of the population will be returned as the generated terrain heightmap.

      <title> User Input </title>
      <paragraph>
        In the optional user input phase, the user is given the opportunity to specify the terrain layout as a map (if this phase is 
        omitted, the generated terrain will have only one region of a single terrain type). The user draws the 2D map as connected 
        polygonal regions using a CAD-style editor GUI and specifies the terrain type of each polygonal region. This map can have an 
        arbitrary number of regions, each with an arbitrarily complicated boundary, allowing the user to exert an arbitrary degree of 
        control over the shape of a terrain by creating custom-shaped regions of different terrain types. The user may save a map that he 
        has created to a file and may load it again at a later time.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        The inputs expected from the user are intentionally primitive, as a convenience for the user &#8212; in the next step, the       
        straight edges created by the user will be approximated by more complex, more believable boundaries. In the vast majority of 
        cases, the user is not going to care about the exact shape of the boundary, only that it is plausible and that it goes 
        approximately where he asked it to go. In the case where the user actually wants fine-grained control over the exact shape of 
        the boundary, he can simply draw the boundary with more line segments &#8212; the shorter each segment is, the more closely the 
        approximation will adhere to it.

      <title> Genetic Boundary Refinement </title>
      <paragraph>
        The first genetic algorithm step consists of a 2D refinement of the edges in the user created polygonal map (if any exist). 
        I call the simple edges created by the user <term>guide boundaries</term>. The purpose of this step is to convert these simple, 
        low-detail edges given by the user into <term>refined boundaries</term>, irregular, high-detail boundaries. Whereas the guide 
        boundary was a single, longer line segment, the refined version is a piecewise-linear curve composed of numerous short line 
        segments connecting the original two endpoints of the guide boundary, but in a meandering, undulating fashion.  The length and 
        number of the line segments used to construct the refined boundary is effectively limited by the spatial resolution of the input 
        heightfields, as detail finer than the resolution of the output heightfields will not appear in the output terrain.

      <title> Genetic Heightfield Construction </title>
      <paragraph>
        The second genetic algorithm step takes the refined map and generates a heightfield conforming to it. There are several 
        challenges to be overcome in order to do this. First, the heightfield construction problem must be phrased as a genetic 
        algorithm. This requires some way of transforming a heightfield into a chromosome and vice versa. It also requires a fitness 
        function for evaluating how viable a particular chromosome/heightfield is. This fitness function will need to consider a variety 
        of factors when assessing a heightfield, including how well each region conforms to its terrain type, how well terrain types 
        meet at their boundaries, and how well features such as ridge-lines and valleys cohere throughout the whole heightfield.  
        Evaluating terrain type conformity will likely involve image processing techniques such as ridge detection, gradient analysis 
        and frequency-spectrum analysis. After observing the failure of their wavelet synthesis approach to reproduce features such as 
        riverbeds, Pelton &amp; Atkinson state, "We believe that another transformation could more accurately describe the terrain 
        features caused by erosion. A system that generates/analyzes terrain in the Fourier space could possibly capture these missing 
        features" <citation ref="Wavelet Synthesis"/>.

      <title> Analysis </title>
      <paragraph>
        The approach outlined above does not fit cleanly into any of the categories defined earlier, but incorporates aspects of several 
        of them. While it is clearly procedural in nature, it is unlike the procedural methods discussed so far in that it possesses a 
        degree of decision-making intelligence as a result of the genetic algorithm. It is a GIS-based method, but uses the GIS data as 
        raw input rather than as the output terrain itself. It is similar to a sculpting method in that it permits an arbitrary degree 
        of user interaction, but allows the user to decide how much oversight he wants to exercise. As a result, my approach combines 
        many of the strengths of the existing methods, and is likely to produce realistic results for less human effort. The major 
        drawback of this approach is its efficiency: due to the nature of genetic algorithms, it is almost certain to require lots of 
        processing time, and may have high memory requirements as well.
