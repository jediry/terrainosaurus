Must do:
    Do variable mutation PMF
        How to distribute PMF when these 3 aren't the only ops?
        What to do when all are zero? Pick one? Throw exception?
    Fixing mean height for HF rendering

Future:
    GA listener again
    Multi facet compat
    Incorporate feature analysis
    Soft mutation (cross-boundary)
    Merge/splice TS & MR
    Fuzzy (i.e., multi-TT genes & ops)

'd be nice:
    Threads
    User selection & alteration of stuff...
    QT UI
    Text in display
    texture
